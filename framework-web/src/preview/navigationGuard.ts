/**
 * The preview's navigation guard: a preview never opens a second browsing
 * context. Nested previews are off inside a preview (design-renderer-data.md
 * §2′.5 item 5), and a frame is only one way to nest one:
 *
 *   - a frame is refused by the preview document's CSP (`frame-src 'none'`,
 *     preview.html);
 *   - a NEW TAB or window is refused here: an "Open in a new tab" link would boot
 *     a second copy of the app from the preview's origin, and any other
 *     `target="_blank"` link would leave the fixture world. `window.open` is
 *     refused by the network guard (networkGuard.ts).
 *
 * In-app links are untouched: the router's own links carry no target and are
 * handled on the memory history. Only an activation that would open another
 * context is refused: a non-self target, or a modifier-click or middle-click
 * that the browser would turn into a new tab. Each refusal is reported, so it
 * shows on the preview's alarm.
 *
 * The decision is a pure function (opensNewContext), unit-tested under node;
 * installNavigationGuard is the thin capture-phase listener around it.
