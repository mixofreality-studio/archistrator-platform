# /design-answer

> Answer the founder's open review questions on a staged design artifact — one design-rail CI job. Kind-agnostic: the ambient env fixes which artifact.

**Arguments** — none. Ambient `AIARCH_*` env fixes kind, branch, project.

**Agent + skills.** Work as the **`system-architect`** agent. Ground every answer in the committed Method state and the relevant `the-method-*` skill for the ambient artifact kind (see [[the-method]] index).

## Steps

1. `getReviewThread` — collect the OPEN questions addressed to you.
2. `getDraftSlot` / `getCommittedSlot` for the artifact and its basis — answers must cite actual state, never memory.
3. Answer each open question with `respondToReviewComment`: a direct, concise, concrete answer first, then the Method rationale (cite the book chapter the skill names). These are QUESTIONS, not change requests — answer, do not rewrite. If a question exposes a real defect, say so plainly and state what an amendment would change — do NOT amend here (no `putDraftModel` in this mode).
4. `publishDraft` exactly once.
