# Compressed Solution

The compressed solution offers management a "go faster" option. It costs more (parallel work or top resources are not free). It is riskier (parallel work increases coordination overhead and execution risk). But it shortens delivery — sometimes by enough to justify the trade.

Rules from the book: parallel work *first*, top resources *second*, never below the death zone, never beyond 30% compression.

## Input

State is git-as-DB: all of this lives in `.aiarch/state/project.json` (a typed JSON aggregate), NOT in `designs/<product>/*.md` or `network.yaml` files. Markdown/DSL/YAML is a render-on-read of the typed state, never the source of truth.

- The committed **normalSolution** artifact in `project.json` → `.normalSolution` (the baseline being compressed, with its resource-assigned network state) and the committed **network** artifact → `.network`
- The committed **planningAssumptions** artifact in `project.json` → `.planningAssumptions`

## Output

The compressed solution is a **typed model committed into `.aiarch/state/project.json` → `.compressedSolution`** — git is the database. It carries this option's own recomputed network state (compression extras and resource swaps), summary metrics, and the comparison-to-normal table. It is NOT a `compressed.md` file; any markdown (including the Step 7 template) is a render-on-read of that JSON slot.

Two usage patterns produce this slot:

1. **Agentic/CI dispatch:** the agent produces the typed `CompressedSolution` model as JSON and commits it into `.compressedSolution` on its session branch; the server reads it back and stages it (`StageArtifactForReview`) for the human review gate (`CommitArtifact` / `RejectArtifact`).
2. **Local interactive:** same — produce the typed model and write it into the `.compressedSolution` slot. Never a `designs/*.md` file.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Apply quick-and-clean first (App C §4.6a)

Per App C: *"Accelerate the project first by quick and clean practices rather than compression."*

Before reaching for compression techniques, check:

| Quick-and-clean lever | Action |
|---|---|
| Are there hidden dependencies you can remove? | Re-examine each dependency in the committed `.network` slot |
| Can the team skip activities that don't add value? | Drop them (rare; usually each was added intentionally) |
| Can specialists replace generalists? | Hire / engage an expert per ch. 9 §1 |
| Is there parallel work the team simply hadn't planned? | Surface and add |
| Are activity estimates inflated by safety padding? | Right-size (don't crash; right-size) |

If quick-and-clean reduces duration meaningfully, use that as your compressed baseline before applying real compression.

### Step 2 — Compress via parallel work (App C §4.6c — preferred)

Per Löwy: *"Compress with parallel work rather than top resources."* Why: parallel work changes the *network* without changing per-activity cost much. Top-resource compression is paying premium for the same activity.

Parallel work mechanics:

1. **Split serial chains.** A → B → C might become {A1, A2} in parallel → {B1, B2} in parallel → C. Requires extra resources but breaks the chain.
2. **Pipeline.** Start B as soon as enough of A is done to unblock B (intra-activity dependency). Requires either splitting A into sub-activities or accepting "soft" dependency.
3. **Enabling activities.** Add activities like "build simulator for component X" so downstream work isn't blocked waiting for X's completion. Per ch. 9, simulators are a classic acceleration technique.
4. **Design-first contract extraction (the primary source of `D###` activities).** Pull a component's **detailed-design phase out into its own `D###` activity** so that other components can begin construction against its *frozen contract* before it is fully built. This is exactly the book's "Client designs first" / per-Manager contract-design enabling activities (ch. 11 Table 11-5; ch. 13 "Adding Enabling Activities"). Apply it **selectively** — only to components that others build against (Managers, Engines, Clients on the critical path), never universally. In the base activity list each component is ONE activity (design is an internal phase, per [[the-method-activity-list]]); design-first extraction is a *compression* move that lives here, in this option's network state, not in the base.
5. **Pre-work for noncoding.** UX design can start before architecture is complete (with risk); infra provisioning can run in parallel with early construction.

For each parallel-work change:
- Add the new activities to this option's network state inside `.compressedSolution` (likely under a `compressed_extras:` list)
- Add the resources needed
- Recompute network

### Step 3 — Compress via top resources (App C §4.6d — secondary)

Per Löwy: *"Compress with top resources carefully and judiciously."*

If parallel work alone doesn't hit the compression target, swap in higher-skilled resources on critical-path activities.

How: top resources have lower duration on the same activity (they're faster). Update the activity's `duration_days` based on the resource's effective throughput multiplier (typically 1.3–1.5× for top-tier).

**Cost implications:** Top resources are more expensive per day. Direct cost rises. Sometimes substantially.

Apply sparingly: only on critical-path activities. Apply broadly and you've inflated direct cost without buying much (high float activities don't accelerate the project).

### Step 4 — Iterate compression

Per ch. 11, compression is iterative. Each iteration:

1. Identify the current critical path.
2. Apply one compression technique to one or more critical activities.
3. Recompute the network.
4. The critical path likely shifts (a previously near-critical chain becomes critical).
5. Repeat on the new critical path.

Stop when:
- You hit the **compression target** (typical: 20–30% reduction from normal).
- You hit the **30% cap** (App C §4.6e: *"avoid compression higher than 30%"*).
- You hit the **death zone** (App C §4.6b: *"never commit to a project in the death zone"*).
- You hit the **efficiency ceiling** (App C §4.6f: efficiency > 25% means brittle).

### Step 5 — Identify the death zone (Ch. 9 §4 — critical)

The death zone is the region of the time-cost curve where any further compression is infeasible at any cost. Beyond it, no amount of money or people can deliver.

Per ch. 9: characterize the death zone via the time-cost curve (full curve built in [[the-method-risk-modeling]]). For now:

- Plot points: each compression iteration gives a (duration, total_cost) point.
- As you compress further, cost rises but duration reduction plateaus.
- The death zone is the asymptote — duration cannot go below a hard minimum no matter what cost you accept.

If your current compressed solution lies in the death zone region, **back off**. Per App C §4.6b: this is a non-negotiable rule.

### Step 6 — Compute final compressed metrics

After iteration converges:

| Metric | Compressed value |
|---|---|
| Duration | N days |
| Direct cost | N man-months (higher than normal — parallel work and/or top resources added) |
| Indirect cost | N man-months (lower than normal — duration is shorter) |
| Total cost | direct + indirect (usually higher than normal, despite indirect drop) |
| Efficiency | N% (verify ≤ 25%) |
| Peak staffing | N (higher than normal due to parallel work) |
| Compression vs normal | N% (verify ≤ 30%) |

App C reminder: compress the project *even if the likelihood of pursuing any of the compressed options is low* (§4.6g). The exercise reveals the time-cost shape, which informs every other option.

### Step 7 — Commit the typed compressed solution to `.compressedSolution`

Produce the typed `CompressedSolution` model and commit it to `.aiarch/state/project.json` → `.compressedSolution`. The markdown below is the equivalent **human rendering** — use it to review the solution, but the source of truth is the slot, not a `compressed.md` file:

```markdown
# Compressed Solution — <Product>

## Summary (vs. normal)

| Metric | Normal | Compressed | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Duration | 120 days | 90 days | -25% ✓ within cap |
| Direct cost | 24 mm | 32 mm | +33% (parallel work + top resources) |
| Indirect cost | 12 mm | 9 mm | -25% (shorter duration) |
| **Total cost** | **36 mm** | **41 mm** | **+14%** |
| Efficiency | 17% | 22% | within cap ✓ |
| Peak staffing | 5 | 8 | parallel work needed |
| Preliminary risk | 0.45 | 0.62 | higher |
| Compression from normal | — | 25% | within 30% cap ✓ |
| Death zone | — | No | ✓ |

## Compression techniques applied

### 1. Parallel work
- Split OrderManager construction into two pipelines (workflow + state-handling) — added junior-dev-4
- Pipeline UX design with first construction activities — added soft dependency
- Built a Pricing Engine simulator so downstream RA work didn't wait

### 2. Top resources
- Assigned senior-dev-1 (top-tier) to A012 (Manager construction) instead of junior — duration 15 → 10 days

## New critical path
A001 → A002p (split) → A012 → ... → AN
Total: 90 days

## Resource assignments
| Activity | Resource | Days | Float |
|---|---|---|---|
...

## Staffing distribution
<chart — shows higher peak than normal>

## Planned earned value
<chart — steeper but still shallow-S>

## Costs (man-months)
| Cost | Compressed |
|---|---|
| Direct | 32 |
| Indirect | 9 |
| Total | 41 |

## Risk flags
- Parallel pipelines increase coordination overhead
- Bus-factor on top-tier senior-dev-1 (now on critical path)
- Soft UX-construction dependency: risk if UX runs late

## When to choose compressed over normal
- Hard deadline that normal would miss
- Revenue/strategic value of earlier delivery > N man-months in extra cost
- Team genuinely has the bench depth for parallel pipelines
```

## Draft-job doctrine (CI dispatch)

This is the normative task the CI draft job (and a local `/project-design` run) executes to produce the `CompressedSolution`. It is self-contained: everything a draft agent needs to design the compressed option is stated here.

Design the COMPRESSED solution: shorter duration via parallel work first and top resources second; raise the staffing cap and/or calendar days/week. Compression beyond ~30% of the normal duration is the death zone — target a modest compression (well under 30%) and stop short of it.

### Solution class rates

classRates MUST be the PlanningAssumptions rateCard derivation — for each class: megatokensInPerDay×(input $/MTok) + megatokensOutPerDay×(output $/MTok) for its modelId, in USD minor units — IDENTICAL across all four solution options (the workers are AI agents; a class's day-cost does not change between options). Option economics differ ONLY through duration, staffing cap, calendar, and buffer — never through invented per-day rates.

## Exit criteria (for router)

`.aiarch/state/project.json` → `.compressedSolution` holds a committed typed model with:
- Comparison table showing duration shorter, total cost higher
- Compression ≤ 30%
- Efficiency ≤ 25%
- Not in death zone
- New critical path identified
- Compression techniques explicitly named

Move to `the-method-risk-modeling`.

## Anti-patterns to reject

- **Compression > 30%** — App C hard rule. Back off.
- **Death zone** — App C hard rule. Back off.
- **Top resources everywhere** — pays premium for activities with float. Apply only to critical path.
- **Parallel work without resource backing** — pretending two juniors can work on one component simultaneously (App C §4.2g: 1:1 component-to-developer).
- **Indirect cost ignored** — compression saves indirect but costs direct. Show both.
- **Skipping the death-zone check** — non-negotiable per App C.
